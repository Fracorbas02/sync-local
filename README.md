# sync-local
This project is under developpment and will (hopefully) one day be finished.

It has one goal : allow your devices to sync your files inside your local network without you having to do anything. This will allow you to have your documents everywhere without using any subscription to cloud companies. Just you, your devices and your files, nothing else.

Ever wanted to have a local synchronisation of your files / folder accross multiple devices whithout using any cloud subscription ? I think i have what you need : use your devices as the cloud and the client, all of this inside your local network, bluetooth or wifi connexion.
